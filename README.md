# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

I used Node and Express environemnts. I setuped them in local machine.

The file server.js should require express() and should create an instance of their app using express.

The Express app instance should be pointed to the folder which contains html, css, and .js files.

The cors package should be installed in the project from the terminal and required in the file server.js, and make instance of the app using cors().

The body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.

Local server should be running and producing feedback to the Command Line through a callback function.
